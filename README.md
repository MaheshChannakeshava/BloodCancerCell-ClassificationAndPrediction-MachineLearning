This is the Research project conducted by me for classification and prediction of Blood Cancer cells using differet Machine Learning Models.
Diagnosing blood cancers is challenging due to the complex nature of the disease and subtle changes in blood cell morphology. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques—Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and deep learning CNN models—for classifying eight types of blood cells.

Key highlights:

Deep Learning (CNN): Achieved high performance in identifying blood cell structures and multiformity.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation and zoom were used to minimize overfitting, improving model generalization.
Ensemble Learning: Stacked SVM and Random Forest with Logistic Regression as a meta-classifier showed improved accuracy and stability across test and validation datasets.
Metrics Evaluated: Accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC were used to assess model effectiveness.
This work emphasizes that leveraging advanced machine learning techniques can enhance blood cancer diagnostics, reduce mortality rates, and improve patient outcomes. It serves as a foundation for developing effective, AI-driven diagnostic tools for blood cancer detection.
